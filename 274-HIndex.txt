I don't even know what H-index is.

The cheap solution to h-index is sorting the array, reversing the order, then iterating through the array.
We check to see if the index is greater than the value at that index. If it is, we return the index.

If we go through the whole loop without any value being less than its index, then the H-index is the entire array.

class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end());
        reverse(citations.begin(), citations.end());

        for(int i = 0; i < citations.size(); i++) {
            if(i >= citations[i]) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return citations.size();
    }
};
