We can have two variables that we update as we iterate through the array. A maximum profit variable and
a minimum price variable. With each number in the array, we check if the current value minus the previous value
is the larger number, or if the previous maximum profit is bigger with a max function. We also check if the smallest
value is the value we saved previously or if its the current value we are on.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int min_price = prices[0];
        int maxprof = 0;

        for(int i=1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            maxprof = max(maxprof, prices[i]-min_price);
            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i]);
        }
        return maxprof;
    }
};
