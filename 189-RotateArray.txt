Sometimes, with problems, there is just something that you have to know when you solve it. That's what it is like for this problem.

You just gotta know.

First, we reverse the entire array. Next, we reverse the first k elements. Then, we reverse the rest of the elements.

class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // The trick here is reversing the whole array, then reverse the first
        // numbers, then reverse the rest of the numbers.
        k = k % nums.size();
        reverse(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k); // first arg start at immediate index, sec arg never gets to the index put in.
        reverse(nums.begin() + k, nums.begin() + nums.size());
    }
};
