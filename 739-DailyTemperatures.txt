For any problem that has the requirements of


Within an array, I'm looking for another index in relation to my current index that is......:
1. Closest to me
2. Greater than, less than, equal to
3. To the left or right

In these circumstances, we use a monotonic stack

Solution:
Attack the array from the back. Have an empty stack initialized. If the stack is empty,
(as it will be for the first value since we are attacking from the back), we can put a 0
for that number. The stack is a dictionary of (key,value) (temperature, index). If a temp
is higher than the previous, then we pop the temp in the stack and push in the new temp. If 
a temp is lower than previous, we return the subtraction of both indexes and push in the new temp.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& temperatures) {
        int n = temperatures.size();
        vector<int> ans(n,0);
        stack<pair<int,int>> s;

        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--){
            while(!s.empty() && s.top().first <= temperatures[i]){
                s.pop();
            }
            if(!s.empty()){
                ans[i] = s.top().second - i;
            }

            s.push({temperatures[i], i});
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
