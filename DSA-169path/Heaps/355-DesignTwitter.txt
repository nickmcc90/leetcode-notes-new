I have no idea how to get through this problem, but let's get through a little
bit of the solution video at a time. I'm at work on 4/5/2024 a Friday, ready to
go home. I don't even have to make dinner so this weekend is gonna be great! Alright
let's get it.

Solution:
This problem comes down to trade-offs with different data structures that we could use to make
each function decently efficient.

We could implement the follow function by using a hashmap that links a key to a list of followeeIds.
