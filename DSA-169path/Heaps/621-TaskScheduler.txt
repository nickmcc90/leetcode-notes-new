MEDIUM

It's better to start with the most frequent characters first. We don't even have to
look at the characters themselves, just the frequency of each. We process the character
with the highest frequency each interval.

We can use a maxHeap to pull the highest frequency character.

This takes O(n) time because we have to sort through the array to get the frequencies, but
the maxHeap takes log n time to pop from.

There is a second part to this problem... using a queue. Apparantely it's optional.
