HARD

Tags: Minheap, Maxheap.

I always forget how to start problems that require you to make a class. Let's
lock in this time.

The problem wants the median from an ordered list of integers. A brute force way
would be to insert each new number into an array and sort it everytime. This would
take O(n) time because each time we put a new number in, we have to move all the
other numbers.

A better way (since we have to grab the numbers from the middle of the array) would
be to have a min heap and a max heap. We will take the max of the min heap and the min
of the max heap. This will work to get the median if both heaps are equal.

If the heaps are unequal, we take the min or max from whatever heap has more numbers in
it.

**Finding the max or min of a heap is O(1) time.
