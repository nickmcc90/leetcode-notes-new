MEDIUM

I solved this by myself!!!!

We make the numbers negative in the maxHeap before heapifying it because there are only minHeaps in python.
Changing the sign of every number in the array makes sure that large numbers will be the smallest number.
We pop values from the heap until our k is depleted. Our result will come out as the wrong sign, so we
always return the opposite sign result.

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        maxHeap = [-s for s in nums]
        heapq.heapify(maxHeap)

        while k > 0:
            result = heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
            k -= 1

        return -result
