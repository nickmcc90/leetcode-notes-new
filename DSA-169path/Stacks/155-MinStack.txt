MEDIUM

Imma use python from now on. Get really good at it.

In python, you can implement a stack with a linked list, an array, just examples.
To carry out the minstack function, we can have another stack in addition to the
first one that holds the minimum value at certain positions in the stack. This is
an O(1) operation to get the min value because we can check the 2nd stack to see what
the min value is. Each time we add a value to the first stack, we add the total min value
to the second stack.

class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.minStack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.stack.append(val)
        val = min(val, self.minStack[-1] if self.minStack else val)
        self.minStack.append(val)

    def pop(self) -> None:
        self.stack.pop()
        self.minStack.pop()
        

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]
        

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.minStack[-1]
        


# Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MinStack()
# obj.push(val)
# obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.getMin()
