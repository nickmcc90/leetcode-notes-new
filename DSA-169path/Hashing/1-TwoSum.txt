EASY

We already did this problem as a prerequiste to the ThreeSum problem in the arrays folder. So, I recoded
the solution without looking at that problem in Python instead of C++.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        map = {}
        diff = 0       
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            diff = target - nums[i]
            if(diff in map):
                return [map[diff], i]
            map[nums[i]] = i
