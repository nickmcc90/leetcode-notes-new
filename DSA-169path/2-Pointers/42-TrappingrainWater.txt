We've done this one already in the top150questions.

HARD

I'll give a lil synopsis of my previous solution for practice, since I had to look back
at my solution.

We initialize two pointers. At the left pointer we record the max height to the left of the pointer ever
recorded, and at the right pointer we record the max height to the right of the pointer ever recorded.
We calculate the water that can be stored at each index.

We start with our pointers on the edges. We see which one is smaller. We move the smaller one inward.
We know that both sides of the water container will be the height of the smallest side for this specific
index. So we always find the water at a specific space AFTER moving the smallest left or right boundary forward.
After figuring out a specific index's water level, we iterate again through the while loop and see which boundary is
smaller.
