So we know that we have to iterate over the whole string to get each element to check if it's a palindrome.

So, this is as simple as checking if the reverse of the string is equal to the original string.

class Solution {
public:
    string firstPalindrome(vector<string>& words) {
        for(auto s : words) {
            string i = s;   // storing the string.
            reverse(i.begin(),i.end()); // the reverse will be equal to the normal.
            if(s==i) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
};
