For the string '123456789', there can only be a minimum of a two digit sequential digit and a nine digit sequential digit.

This means there is a finite number of SQ's (sequential digits) to look for.

We can go through each length, through each possiblity, and compare it with the low and high values.

To do this, we take a substring from the string '123456789', and convert it to an integer.


***I am getting the hint on how to solve problems like these. You need to really break the problem down
and understand it fully without bringing any code into it. Then, once we've thought of everything, we can
figure out how to code it.
