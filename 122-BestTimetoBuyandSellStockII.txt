We have a total_profit variable that increases as we move from a low
number to a higher number. It doesn't matter how many times we 'sell',
since we can sell a lot, we can increase our profit every single time that
we reach a number, and the next number is higher.

class Solution {
public:

    let profit = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
      if(prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
        profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
      }
    }
    return profit;
}
